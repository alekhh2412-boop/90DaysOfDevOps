1.The core components of Linux (kernel, user space, init/systemd)

-There are 4-5 types of linux architecture -
1.hardware (monitor, CPU,...)
2.kernel (core of linux ,processes run in background)
3.shell (it is a interface between user and machine ,Terminal)
4.utilities/applcations (eg.Netfix)
5.user (The one who manage)

2.How processes are created and managed

ps - ps is the command that is commonly use in linux for chacking process
top - top is also cmd which shows us running processes
hrop - it is same as top cmd but htop shows colourful and good looking runing processes
Kill - using kill cmd we can kill process 

3.What systemd does and why it matters

systemd manage services
systemctl - system control
eg.systemctl status nginx
it shows status of this service
